#### Bio: 
I work as an AQA engineer, but always had an enormous interest in development. Way before this path towards IT, I was just an office clerk that was trying to get out of the circumstances that I put myself into. 
Three years ago or so, I've decided that I needed to change my life and I started learning a programming language. I try to work and learn Frontend Development when I have some free time. What got my interest was that Fronted was something that could immediately show results of one's hard word. I found the RS School and that was the sign of sorts that my goals are not something unachievable, but on the contrary there for me to reach.
I hope that this path will lead me to become a good Frontend developer, the one who can really accomplish things that seem to be impossible.
